**##Comparative Analysis of Static Noise Margin in 6T and 8T SRAM Cells Based on Transistor Sizing##**

This project presents a comparative analysis of Static Noise Margin (SNM) in conventional 6T and modified 8T SRAM cells using LTspice simulations. The study focuses on evaluating how transistor sizing, particularly the cell ratio (CR), impacts Hold Static Noise Margin (HSNM) and Read Static Noise Margin (RSNM) in both architectures.

As CMOS technology scales down, SRAM stability becomes increasingly sensitive to transistor sizing, process variations, and low-voltage operation. The conventional 6T SRAM cell suffers from read disturb issues due to the direct coupling between storage nodes and bitlines during read operations. In contrast, the 8T SRAM architecture introduces a decoupled read path to enhance read stability.

This project investigates these differences systematically by performing DC simulations and butterfly curve analysis to extract SNM values.
